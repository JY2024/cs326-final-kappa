# Examples of CRUD Functionality

Read (recipe info on load, and render on the page)\

![Read](screenshots-milestone2/read.png)\
Update (press green button to add to user's saved recipes, updating user info)\
This is the main feed page. When the user presses the green button, the recipe is saved to the user's saved recipes because the user decided that they like this particular recipe. This updates the user's information (specially, the saved recipes). Then, the user can go to their own profile page to view their saved recipes.\
