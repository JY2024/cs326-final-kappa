## Innovative Idea
Have you ever wanted to find the perfect recipe that matches your cravings and preferences, but were too lazy to browse online? Our project idea is a website where users can post recipes and conveniently browse other people’s recipes, automatically calculating how much the recipe matches your own preferences. Our application closely mimics the functionality of Tinder, where you “swipe” left (no) or right (yes) if the profile you see on the screen suits your liking. If you “match,” you can then chat with and discuss cooking tips with the creator who uploaded the recipe. Features include posting recipes, likes and/or rating features, comments, and reactions. Our app focuses on convenience and community-building.

This is unlike any existing online cookbook or recipe app. By allowing users to have preset preferences, they will only be shown recipes that match what they are looking for. Instead of searching for a recipe that matches your preferences on google, our website will only ever show you recipes that match your profile. The swiping mechanic means users won’t waste time reading recipes that don’t look appetizing to them.

## Important Components
The primary function our app provides is connecting users with the authors of recipes, allowing for conversation with the creator on how to change the recipe to fit your preferences.
The app’s ability to match user preferences by showing recipes which are more likely to interest them is also one of the main features of the app. Furthermore, our app allows user interaction with recipes - showing a “yum” meter which indicates user sentiment, as well as a comment section for people to vocalize their thoughts.
